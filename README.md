# Welcome
This is me taking notes on GitHub while learning `Terraform`. I will probably be going to need this document when I forget how it works. If you find something useful, be my guest. I will try to update this whenever I study.

## Introduction
It's like programming language to program infrastructure in the Cloud. But not only infrastructure!

Works with:
- Amazon Web Services
- Google Cloud Platform
- Microsoft Azure
- Digital Ocean
- VMware Cloud
- Alibaba Cloud
- Many other platforms, such as; GitHub NewRelic, Okta
- You can create support for your own platform yourself

About Terraform:
- Syntax of code is **HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)**
- Regular text files with extension `.tf` and `.tfvars`
- Use any text editor
- No need to compile code
- Works on: **Windows**, **Linux**, **MacOS**, **OpenBSD**, **Solaris**

Another alternative tolls for infrastructure as a code:
- AWS CloudFormation
- Ansible
- Puppet
- Chef

Example of Terraform code to provision Static IP Address

**Azure:**
```
resource "azurerm_public_ip" "my_static_ip_address" {
    name                        = "ip-for-my-web-page"
    location                    = "eastus"
    resource_group_name         = azurerm_resource_group.myterraformgroup.name
    allocation_method           = "Dynamic"
}
```

**AWS:**
```
resource "aws_eip" "my_static_ip_address" {
    vpc                         = true
}
```

**GCP:**
```
resource "google_compute_address" "my_static_ip_address" {
    name                        = "ip-for-my-web-page"
}
```

Key advantages using Terraform for infrastructure as code:
- ***Automate*** infrastructure provisioning
- ***Change***, ***Update***, ***Delete***, ***Recreate*** infrastructure
- Create ***cloned*** environments of infrastructure
- ***Validate*** changes before apply to production
- Fast grow of environment
- ***Reuse*** code for similar projects and reduce develop costs
- Enhance ***collaboration*** between DevOps teams

## Setup
Download the ***Terraform*** from [terraform.io](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)

**For Windows:**
- Download the `.exe` file.
- Create the folder path as `C:\Terraform`
- Copy the `.exe` file to new path
- Open `System Environment Variables`
- Click on `Environment Variables`
- Choose `Path` and click on `Edit`
- Click on `New`
- Paste the path `C:\Terraform`
- To check, open any terminal and enter `terraform --version`

> You might also want to install `Terraform` extension to your IDE.

Before we begin, we need to create a ***IAM*** user and give administrator permissions and generate secret key and access key for our Terraform:
- Login AWS Console (if you have multiple accounts, use `root` account)
- Click on `IAM`, then `Users` under IAM resouces
- Add user
- Give a name and check the box with `Programmatic access`
- Continue with `Permissions`
- Choose `Attach existing policies directly` and check the `AdministratorAccess`
- Continue to tags and you can leave it as it is
- Continue to Review and then create the user
- Save the ***access key ID*** and ***secret access key*** or download the ***.csv*** file
- For ***Windows***, open `PowerShell`
  - Enter the commands below:
    - `$env:AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<accessKeyID>"`
    - `$env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<secretAccessKey>"`
    - `$env:AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="<region>"`
- For ***Linux***/***MacOS***, open `terminal`
  - Enter the commands below:
    - `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<accessKeyID>"`
    - `export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<secretAccessKey>"`
    - `export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="<region>"`

> The ***EXPORT*** command will be lost once you close the terminal.

> The ***region*** might be `us-west-2` or `eu-central-1` or any other region on AWS, whatever you like.
